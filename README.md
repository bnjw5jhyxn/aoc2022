# Advent of Code 2022

## how to run
Put the input for day 1 in 01.txt, the input for day 2 in 02.txt, etc.
Uncomment the lines in main.jl that run the solutions on the input files you downloaded.
```
$ julia main.jl
```
Enter `1A` to see the solution for day 1, part A on the input you provided,
or `1AE` to see the solution on the example input.
See main.jl for the full list of strings you can enter.
To quit, push ctrl+D (this sends an end-of-file to standard input).
